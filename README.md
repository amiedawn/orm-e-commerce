## Description: 

This project is the back-end for an e-commerce website. A database is created and seeded with test data. After the server is started, Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. API routes for categories, products, and tags allow a user to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. It also uses the dotenv package to store the username, password, and database safely and privately.

## Installation Instructions:

You will need to install several dependencies for this application after cloning the repository at https://github.com/amiedawn/orm-e-commerce : npm, dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize. You can test the API routes with Insomnia Core after loading the database, seeding the tables, and running the server with "npm start". 

## Usage Information:

To test the API routes in this application, you will first need to create the database with the schema.sql file and seed it. Then test each API route for categories, products, and tags with Insomnia Core.  The following video shows all the routes working in Insomnia Core:<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgyONCV5VhhXRbY8VJy5Hxli-PiYfvie/view
